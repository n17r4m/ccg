Gameplay basics:
SETUP
    Both players have a deck of size (N=25)*
    Beginning of game:
        1- Both players draw 4 cards
        2- Determine first player
        3- First player begins their turn
    
    A Turn consists of 3 Phases:
        DRAW:       Player draws (D=1) cards from the top of their deck, 
                    into their Hand.
        PLAY:       Player plays (P=1) card (if able). Played cards go to the
                    Waste.
        DISCARD:    Player discards down to (H=5) cards in hand. Discarded cards
                    go to the Waste.
    
    A card may be in one of 3 places:
        DECK:       The player's combined health pool and card source.
                    + Ordered
                    + Randomly initialized from 'the' collective card pool
        HAND:       The player's available cards. 
                    + Unordered set
        WASTE:      The player's discard pile. 
                    + Ordered
        
    A player may be afflicted by 'Blindness':
        Affected player places their Hand facedown for the duration of the 
        effect, playing and drawing cards without reading their text.
        /!\ --- Should we say 'play cards by random selection' or let players 
        play by memory?
    
    During the PLAY Phase, players may play exactly one card, either a mutation
    or a variant card. (I don't think it need be stated that there are no
    interrupts; no counterspells, etc. A turn is a turn.)
    
    * using variables to test stuff

Two types of cards:

    Mutations   
        Cards that have an effect only when played.

    Variants    
        When played, stay on the field until replaced by another Variant. 
        There can only be one active at a time!
